## General info

This project is a mini-project that I decided to make as a part of learning React. It contains some basic components that may come in handy while developing a website. It may contain a lot of bugs and shitty code as I'm a complete newbie, so any help is very much appreciated ðŸ˜Š.

## Technologies

Here's a list of all the things that I used or am using for building Componentum.

* Tech 1 - version 1.0
* Tech 2 - version 2.0
* Tech 3 - version 3.0

## Status

The project is currently _in progress_. Will be sharing the updates as soon as possible ðŸ™‚.

## Inspiration

Componentum is based on [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com/), and has similar usage, just that the UI components are made in React.
